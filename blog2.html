      <h2 style="color: #19547b;">Pakistan travel guide: Glaciers in Pakistan</h2>
      <p><em>By Faizan Ahmad Khan / September 7, 2023</em></p><Br>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">


      Many people travel to Pakistan for the opportunity to undertake a high-altitude trek and see some of the highest
      mountains in the world.

      Of course, like most alpine regions, there is a fair amount of glacier present on these excursions.

      Actually, the concentration of glaciers in Pakistans is actually extremely high. If you travel to the northern
      areas like Baltistan, Hunza, or Chitral, you’re bound to run into a glacier eventually.

      The glaciers of Pakistan are truly marvelous to see in person and even more thrilling to cross (when done
      properly). There’s just nothing else quite like seeing a glacier encroach on a bridge, ready to swallow it, or
      navigate the mangled jaws of the likes of the Baltoro.

      In this week’s article, we’re going to take a closer look at Pakistan’s glaciers and talk about why they’re so
      significant. You’ll get to know famous glaciers a bit better and will learn what it takes to traverse these icy
      mammoths. By the end, we hope you will be inspired to visit Pakistan and see its glaciers for yourself.<br><br></p>

      <h3>What makes Pakistan’s glaciers so special?</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      When some people think of Pakistan, they imagine it as either a) full of crowded, hectic cities or b) desert.
      Quite literally, it’s something in-between Iran and India.<br><br>
      <b>Little do they know that Pakistan is actually one of the most glaciated countries on the planet.</b><br><br>
      In fact, there are over 7,000 known glaciers in Pakistan and together these form the most amount of ice outside
      the polar regions!

      Crisscrossed by the three highest mountain ranges in the world – the Karakoram, Himalaya, and Hindu Kush –
      Northern Pakistan is totally carved out of ice and rock. The hidden valleys, soaring peaks, and mighty rivers such
      as the Indus all exist thanks to the glaciers.

      The glaciers also provide much-needed irrigation to the local communities and are practically the lifeblood of all
      civilization in the north. The locals have gotten pretty good at taking advantage of these glaciers, creating
      intricate systems of canals for watering crops and removing pieces of it for refrigeration. Without the glaciers,
      there would be no life in the rugged north.</p><br>

      <h3>Are Pakistan’s glaciers melting?</h3>
      Mostly yes, but also no.<br>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
      For starters, climate change has indeed affected parts of Pakistan in a profound way. Rapidly rising temperatures
      lead to rapidly melting snow, which then causes massive flooding. Whole villages have been swept away and people
      frequently drown. Like the rest of the world’s alpine areas, many glaciers in Paksitan are receding.

      Conversely, some glaciers in Pakistan appear not to be shrinking. In fact, they appear to be growing. This
      paradoxical phenomenon has come to be called “The Karakoram Anomaly” by researchers.
      Experts are not sure why or how the anomaly is possible. Many attribute the unusual trend to the ubiquitous rubble
      covering the glacier, which acts as insulation against rising temperatures. Others say it’s just a poor conclusion
      drawn from incomplete field data – the Karakoram are, after all, extremely difficult to work in. Ultimately, the
      Karakoram Anomaly remains just an interesting theory.

      Regardless of their apparent stability, the glaciers of Pakistan are still threatened by climate change. They may
      not be shrinking as noticeably or quickly as the Himalaya, but that’s not saying they’re completely immune either.
      Time will tell what their actual fate will be.</p><br>

      <h3> Notable glaciers in Pakistan</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
       Pakistan hosts over 7000 glaciers! Here are a few that you’ll probably hear about when planning a trip
      there.<br><br>

      <b>Baltoro Glacier</b><br>
      <b>Length:</b> 39 miles/63 km<br><Br>
      The fifth-longest glacier in the world and home to four of the world’s fourteen 8000-meter peaks: K2, Broad Peak,
      Gasherbrum I, and Gasherbrum II. It is regarded as one of the most awe-inspiring locations known to man and its
      sheer grandeur has begotten famous nicknames like “The Throne Room of the World”.

      From the Baltoro springs dozens of other smaller, yet still impressive glaciers, namely the Trango Glacier,
      Chogolisa Glacier, and Austin-Goodwin Glacier at the foot of K2.

      The Baltoro Glacier is also the setting for the superlative K2 Base Camp Trek. Like a giant ice-laden red carpet
      (or rather blue), the glacier leads you further and further up until you reach the king itself: K2. Surrounded by
      some of the world’s highest mountains, navigating the jagged snout of the glacier is a truly once-in-a-lifetime
      experience.<br><Br>

      <b> Biafo Glacier</b><br>
      <b> Length:</b> 42 miles/67 km<br><br>

      Starting in Askole – the same starting point of the Baltoro – and running all the way north to intersect the
      Hispar Glacier, the Biafo is technically the longest glacier (completely) in Pakistan.

      The Biafo Glacier is somewhat similar in topography to the Baltoro, being mostly laden with rubble. Rimming the
      sides are semi-arid meadows that locals use for cattle grazing. Camping is relatively comfortable.

      Though it may not feature such famous giants, like K2, walking up the Biafo is no less stunning. The scenery is
      just as stunning and even surpasses the Baltoro in some ways. Here, you will get to see the infamously terrifying
      Latok group, which is considered by many climbers to host some of the most dangerous alpine-style climbs in the
      world. The stories from here are gnarly.<Br><br>

      <b>Hispar Glacier</b><br>
      <b>Length:</b> 30 miles/49 km<Br><br>

      The Hispar and Biafo combine to form not only the longest glacial system outside the polar regions but also one of
      the greatest treks in the world: Snow Lake.

      The Biafo is not like the Baltoro or Biafo Glaciers – it is much icier than the other two, which is why they call
      it “Snow Lake”. When standing on the glacier, all you’ll see is miles and miles and empty whiteness punctuated by
      the jagged spires that typify the Karakoram. It is a truly unique and spectacular site, of which the original
      discoverer, Martin Conway, said:<br><br>

      <b>“Beyond all comparison the finest view of mountains it has ever been my lot to behold.”</b><br><br>

      But with more ice comes more technical challenges. Trekkers must rope up when crossing the glacier lest they risk
      falling into one of the many crevasses. After all, this is real glacier as one comes to imagine them.<Br><Br>

      <b>Siachin Glacier</b><br>
      <b> Length: </b>47 miles/76 km<br><br>

      “Longest glacier in all of the Karakoram” and “second largest in the world outside of the polar regions” are a few
      of the Siachin Glacier’s impressive distinctions.

      Unfortunately, the distinction that garners the most attention for the Siachin is that it’s often considered “the
      world’s highest battlefield”. For the last 40 years, the glacier has been disputed territorially by India and
      Pakistan, and battles have erupted here in the past. As such, the Siachin has become a symbol of animosity between
      the two warring nations.<br>

      It’s a shame too because the Siachin Glacier features some truly magnificent alpine landscapes, comparable to the
      Baltoro. We’ll just have to wait for Pakistan and India to settle their beef first before visiting – and you’ll
      know we’ll be the first in line!<Br><Br>

      <b> Batura Glacier</b><br>
      <b>Length:</b> 35 miles/57 km<br><Br>

      Located in the Hunza Valley, the Batura Glacier is the longest in Pakistan outside of Baltistan. Like the Baltoro
      and Biafo, this one is a massive traffic jam of rock, ice, and earth.

      The Batura is not commonly visited or seen by trekkers, mostly due to the absence of notable peaks or trails in
      the vicinity. Most settle for seeing more accessible glaciers nearby, like the Passu or Ghulkin Glaciers.

      But the Batura Glacier really is impressive, especially when seen from above.

      The best views of the Batura Glacier are from the Patundas Meadow, which we visit on our Discover the Hunza Valley
      itinerary. Straddling both the Batura and Passu Glaciers, you’ll get a bird’s eye view of both from here. The
      sunsets are particularly incredible.<Br><br>
