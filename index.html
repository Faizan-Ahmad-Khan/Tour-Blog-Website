        One of the things people want to know before going: is Pakistan safe? A fair question!
        For years, Pakistan was associated with violence. Terrorist groups were in power in many rural areas and terror
        attacks were common in cities. Heck, even now many governments advise against travel to (parts of) Pakistan.
        There’s no denying the country is still perceived as dangerous.<br>
